CDS alleles of 128 HLA region genes extracted from homozygous individuals

I am also working on full gene alignemnts for depositing here. It will take a while to get them all done, so email me if you don't see your favourite gene yet. For now I am just using the gene sequence for every distinct CDS rather than every distinct gene sequence; contact me if you want more.
