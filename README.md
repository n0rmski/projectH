CDS alleles of 140 HLA region genes extracted from homozygous individuals.

There are 800 sequences here, and their acession numbers are listed in Supplemental Table S3 of the paper.

This is in addition to the 23 HLA genes that are curated by the IPD (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ipd/imgt/hla/).

I am also working on full gene alignments [see 'alignments' branch].
