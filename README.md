Alignments of 128 HLA region genes extracted from 95 homozygous individuals*

These are full gene alignments for the MHC region genes. It will take a while to get them all done, so email me if you don't see your favourite gene yet. For now I am just using the gene sequence for every distinct CDS rather than every distinct gene sequence; contact me if you want more.

For IPD curated genes (HLAxx, MIC and TAP) - I only included the novel sequences pending official names. The accession numbers for these sequences are listed in Supplemental Table S2.

*The CDS for these genes (ie the exons) are described in Norman et al. 2017. Genome Research (in press) and given here in the [data] branch.
