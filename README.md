Alignments of 128 MHC-region genes extracted from 95 homozygous individuals*

These are full gene alignments for the MHC region genes. They are in addition to the data of the paper and were not included in the reviewed version. For now I am just using the gene sequence for every distinct CDS rather than every distinct gene sequence; contact me if you want more.

For IPD curated genes (HLA-xx, MIC and TAP) - I only included the novel sequences pending official names. These sequences -are- in the paper and their accession numbers are listed in Supplemental Table S2.

*The CDS for these genes (ie the exons) are described in Norman et al. 2017. Genome Research (in press) and available in the [data] branch.
